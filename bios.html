I've also recently become very interested in electronics, and how simple electrical devices that we use every day work.  Outside of school, I've always had a passion for sports - especially water polo.  I've had an amazing time playing on the MIT water polo team and participating in various intramural sports over the years.</p>        </div>

            <div class="bio"><p>I'm a junior studying Mechanical Engineering here at MIT concentrating in Product Development. I'm originally from Pasadena, California and if there is anything that the cold Boston winters have taught me, it's that I have to move back to California after I graduate. Luckily, I have had the opportunity to live in the Bay Area for 6 months of my Junior year as an intern at Apple in Cupertino. I work as a Product Design Engineer in the Packaging Product Design group, working on Apple Watch products.

                Growing up, I've always been a big outdoorsman. I've traveled the world backpacking, taking me everywhere from summiting the Grand Tetons in Wyoming to climbing the Alps and Pyrenees.</p><p> I'm sort of a water creature, as I play on the Mens Varsity Water Polo team and try to spend more time in the water surfing than on land when I get to visit home. I'm an active member of the Undergraduate Association on campus as Chair of the Special Projects Committee, where I manage a group of undergraduates to develop new ideas to improve student life at MIT. This past semester we've focused on mental health awareness, bringing administrators and students together for town hall meetings, as well as on food, attempting to bring a diverse selection of Food Trucks to the MIT community.

                I've UROPedin the Media Lab for two years, working on creating smarter homes in the CityHome project. Specifically I was helping to design pneumatic actuators that can move furniture and walls around your home to make spaces in metropolitan cities more efficient. I also am working on a startup with a group out of San Diego focusing on drone defense technology. Lastly, I freelance as a graphic designer and web developer, helping MIT and local startups with their brand design and web / mobile presence.

                And when I'm not doing all this other stuff, I try to find time to travel with my girlfriend, get this fraternity up and running, and rock climb.    </p> </div>

I like hands on projects and working cooperatively with teammates to accomplish goals, which is what lead me to pursue Mechanical Engineering here at MIT. At the same time, I see the value in being an effective leader, and a good communicator, which lead me to also take Business Management classes here as well. I'm a work hard play hard kind of guy, and I always try to bring a lot of energy into whatever project I'm currently working on. I think the DU mentor program sounds very compelling, and I can't wait to get the chance to meet and talk with some of the many mentors that have signed up to do it

I'm very interested in applications of machine learning techniques, the development of augmented & virtual reality, and the future of quantum computation.

Outside of school, I like to workout, hike, practice gymnastics, snowboard, play sports, and play drums.
